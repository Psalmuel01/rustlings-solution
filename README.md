# Rustlings Solutions

This repository contains my completed solutions to the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.  
Rustlings is an interactive tutorial that helps you learn the Rust programming language by solving small exercises.

## About Rustlings
Rustlings is a collection of small Rust exercises that cover:
- Variables & Mutability
- Functions
- Ownership & Borrowing
- Structs & Enums
- Pattern Matching
- Collections
- Generics
- Traits
- Error Handling
- Lifetimes
- Modules & Crates
- Macros
- And more...

Itâ€™s an excellent way to **learn-by-doing** and get familiar with the Rust syntax, concepts, and standard library.

## How to Run
If you want to run these exercises yourself:

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rustlings.git

2. **Install Rustlings**

   ```bash
   cargo install rustlings
   ```

3. **Run the exercises**
